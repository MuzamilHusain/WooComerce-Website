## Pre-requisites

### Setting up the test environment

Follow [E2E setup instructions](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/e2e/README.md).

### Setting up core tests

#### Version 0.2.0 or newer

Version 0.2.0 added a test installer that will populate the `tests/e2e/specs` folder with test scripts for all the current core test suite. It also creates sample configuration files including all the configuration data needed to run the core tests.

- Install the e2e-environment `npm install @woocommerce/e2e-environment --save-dev`
- Run the installer `npx wc-e2e install @woocommerce/e2e-core-tests`
- Merge the sample configuration files:
  - `tests/e2e/docker/woocommerce.e2e-core-tests.sh` => `initialize.sh`
  - `tests/e2e/config/default-woocommerce.e2e-core-tests.json` => `default.json`

#### Version 0.1.X or other test runner

- Create the folder `tests/e2e/specs` in your repository if it does not exist.
- To add a core test to your test suite, create a new `.test.js` file within `tests/e2e/specs` . Example code to run all the shopper tests:
```js

const { runShopperTests } = require( '@woocommerce/e2e-core-tests' );

runShopperTests();

```

## Retrying/Re-running tests

On a new site, the setup and activation tests prepare the site for the remainder of the tests. To retry/rerun the test suite on a site where setup/onboarding test have already run use the environment variable `E2E_RETEST=1`.

## Contributing a new test

- In your branch create a new `example-test-name.test.js` under the appropriate folder in the [`specs`](specs) directory.
- Jest does not allow its global functions to be accessed outside the jest environment. To allow the test code to be published in a package import any jest global functions used in your test
```js
const {
	it,
	describe,
	beforeAll,
} = require( '@jest/globals' );
```
- Wrap your test in a function and export it
```js
const runExampleTestName = () => {
	describe('Example test', () => {
		beforeAll(async () => {
			// ...
		});

		it('do some example action', async () => {
            // ...
		});
        // ...
    });
});

module.exports = runExampleTestName;
```
- Add your test to [`specs/index.js`](specs/index.js)
```js
const runExampleTestName = require( './grouping/example-test-name.test' );
// ...
module.exports = {
// ...
    runExampleTestName,
}
```
