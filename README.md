**Repository Structure**
Plugins: Our repository contains plugins that relate to or otherwise aid in the development of WooCommerce.
WooCommerce Core: The core WooCommerce plugin is available in the plugins directory.
Packages: Contained within the packages directory are all of the PHP and JavaScript provided for the community. Some of these are internal dependencies and are marked with an internal- prefix.
Tools: We also have a growing number of tools within our repository. Many of these are intended to be utilities and scripts for use in the monorepo, but, this directory may also contain external tools.
