              While our goal is to address all the issues reported in this repository, \
              GitHub should be treated as a place to report confirmed bugs only.\n\n\
              The type of issue you submitted looks like a support request which may or may not reveal a bug once proper \
              troubleshooting is done.  In order to confirm the bug, please follow one of the steps below:\n\n\
              - Review [WooCommerce Self-Service Guide](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-self-service-guide/) \
              to see if the solutions listed there apply to your case;\n\
              - If you are a paying customer of WooCommerce, contact WooCommerce support by \
              [opening a ticket or starting a live chat](https://woocommerce.com/contact-us/);\n\
              - Make a post on [WooCommerce community forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/)\n\n\
              If you confirm the bug, please provide us with clear steps to reproduce it.\n\n\
              We are closing this issue for now as it seems to be a support request and not a bug. \
              If we missed something, please leave a comment and we will take a second look.'

              At some point, we may revisit our priorities and look through the list of suggestions like this one to see if it \
              warrants a second look.\n\n\
